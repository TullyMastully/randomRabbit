# How To Install

* In order for this to work, make sure you have Python installed. If not, please visit https://www.python.org/downloads/
When downloading the "discordbot.py" file, save it somewhere on your computer. (Recommended to save on your desktop as it's easier to access).

1. Visit https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
2. Click on 'New App'
3. Name your bot whatever you'd like. Preferably "Random Rabbit". You can also add a description and a profile picture, but these steps aren't necessary. 
4. Click on 'Create App'
5. If you've done all steps correctly thus far, a green box that says 'GREAT SUCCESS!' will appear. Scroll now in the page until you'll see
a button titled 'Create a Bot User', Click on it. If a box pops up, click on 'Yes, do it!'.
6. Scroll up and search for a button titled 'Generate OAuth2 URL' and click on it. Here you can edit the bot's permission, make sure to bot have permission to send messaages and embed links. The rest is up to you.
7. In the same page, search for a long link, with a button at the end of it titled 'Copy'. Copy the link and paste it in a new tab.
8. Once you've copied the link and entered the website, select the server you'd like your bot to be in, if you can't find it, make sure you have 'Manage Server' permissions. And then click 'Authorize'. The bot should now be in your server.

# The Bot Is Offline, How Can I Make It Go Online?

This is the part where you'll need to edit some of the code, but don't you worry, these steps are very simple.

1. Go back to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and click the bot you've created earlier.
2. Scroll down in the page until you'll see a button titled 'Token: click to reveal': This token is private and shall not be sent to anyone. Click on the button, and copy the token.
3. Go back to where you've saved the 'discordbot.py' file, and right click it, and then click on 'Edit with IDLE'. Scroll down until the very last line of code, and in there, change the "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" to the token you've copied, and save the file.
4. Click 'F5' on your keyboard to run the file. If everything went according to plan, no errors should appear and the bot should go online.

... And that's it! If you've done all steps correctly, good job! To check if the bot is working, go to one of your text channels and type "!rabbit" - commands are not case sensitive. The bot should send you a random rabbit picture. This command is accessible by everyone!
